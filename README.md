python -m http.server 8000

# Node (if you have npx)
npx serve
```

```
├── index.html      # Main landing page

└── assets/         # Images, etc (add as needed)
```

## TODO

- [ ] Add Calendly/Cal.com booking link

## Notes

Built to convert visitors → discovery calls. Every section either builds trust or removes objections.
